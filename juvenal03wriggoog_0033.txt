INTRODUCTION xxix

45. Α favorite position ior the subject isat the end of
the sentence (1. 6; 14. 35), and a subject common to both
parts ol a compound sentenoe often stands with the last
verb at or near the end of the sentence ; as

14. ¹94·19s sed caput intactum buxo naresque pilosas adnotet et
grandes miretur Laelius alas.

46. The antecedent often stands in the relative sentence,
generally at or near the end; as

3. 267 nechabet quem porrigat ore trientem ; 13. 9⁴ dummodo vel
caecus teneam quos abnego nummos.

47.· Α substantive and its agreeing adjective may stand:
(a) at the beginning and end of the verse; as

10.168 unus Pellaeo iuveni non sufficit orbis.
ιο. 182 ipsum conpedibus qui vinxerat Ennosigaeum.

(b) at the beginning and end of the second hall; as

1ο. 31 sed facilis cuivis rigidi censura cachinni.
ιο. 117 quern sequitur custos angintae vernula capsae.

(c) at the end of each half3 as

10. 178 prandente et madidis cantat quae Sostratus alis.
13. 109 nam curn magna malae superest audacia causae.

Nora- Such leonine verses, suggestlve of rbyme (like those under c), are
quite common in Juvenal, and are somewhat frequentin Cicero’s hexaueters.
The sanie arrangement of words is sonetlmes found in the Sapphic verse, and in
the Asclepiad (ag. Hor. C. l. 22 and l. 1), and in the dactylic pentameter of the
elegiae couplet.

48. Anastraphe. As in all other writers, the preposition
cum follows a personal pronoun, but Juvenal never places
it after a relative pronoun; as

1. 101 vexant limen et ipsi nobiscum ,· 10. ²3 5 nec vultum agnoscit
amici, cum qua praeterita cenavit nocte.

In onlya few cases do other prepositions follow their
nouus or pronouns:

(a) a monosyllabic preposition standing between the noun and its
modlfier: 11. 113 litare ab Oceani.
