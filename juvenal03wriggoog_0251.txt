nullum numen habes si sit prudentia3 nos te, ’ μς
nos facimus, Fortuna, deam. mensura tamen quae
sufficiat census, si quis me consulat, edam:

in quantum sitis atque fames et frigora poscunt,
quantum, Epicure, tibi parvis suffecit in hortis,
quantum Socratici ceperunt ante penates;

numquam aliud natura, aliud sapientia dicit.

acribus exemplis videor te cludere? misce

ergo aliquid nostris de moribus, effice summam

bis septem ordinibus quam lex dignatur Othonis.

haec quoque si rugam trahit extenditque labellum, 325
sume duos equites fac tertia quadringenta.
