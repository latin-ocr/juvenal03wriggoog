SATVRA VII

octo, decem comites an post te sella, togati
ante pedes. ideo conducta Paulus agebat
sardonyche, atque ideo pluris quam Gallus agebat,
quarn Basilus. rara in tenui facundia panno 145
quando licet Basilo flentem producere matrem? ¹
quis bene dicentem Basilum ferat? accipiat te
Gallia vel potius nutricula causidicorum
Africa, si placuit mercedem ponere linguae.

Declamare doces? o ferrea pectora Vetti, 150
cum perimit saevos classis numerosa tyrannos.
nam quaecumque sedens modo legerat, haec eadem

, stans

perferet atque eadem cantabit versibus isdem;

142. comites, clients, as in 1.
rip-togati ante pedes: cf.
anteambulo, Mart. 11. 18. 53 Ill.
7. a.

143. conducta sardonyche: ie.
with a glittering ring hired lor the
occasion. - Paulus, Gallus, Ba-
silus (lntr. 64 al: any poor causi-
dici.

¹44· pluris: lor a larger fee.

146. flentem producere ma-

trem: iae. when will he have an
important case and an opportunity
to produce in court the mother oi
his client, in order to move the
hearts of the iudices?
- 147. accipiat te Gallia: i.e. go
there to practise your profession.
The provincials were much given
to litigation, and able to pay large
iees. Some of the foremost advo
cates in Rome came from Gaul,
Spain, and Africa.

150-214. Pity the poor teacher
of rhetoric. He listens day after
day to the same old stull, yet must
often go to law to get the scanty
compensation which he has earned.

Quintilian's tortune was due solely
to good luck.
,othl&litteratim
young men ior the practice oi law
and lor public lile-ferrea: be-
cause he can listen unmoved to so
many appeals.—Vetti: a rhetori-
cian. According to Pliny (N. H. =
XXIX. 8) there was a physician
Vettius Valens who was also dis
tinguished in oratory.

151. perimit tyrannos: ie. in
their declamatione they denounce
tyrants and justiiy their assassina-
tion. Tyranny and tyrannicide
were common subjects ior decla-
marion—numerosa, large, but
perhaps with a suggestion of its
earlier meaning, tunesul, sing-song;
cf. cantabit, vs. r 5 3.

15²· sedens modo legerat:
sc. classis. They had read their
exercises to the teacher while
seated, they will speak thern be-
fore him while standing; cf. Plin.
Ep. vl. 6. 6 dicenti milri sollicitus
adsistat, adsidet recitanti.
