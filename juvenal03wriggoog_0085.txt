SATVRA III

pinguia crura luto, planta mox undique magna

calcor, et in digito clavus mihi militis haeret.

nonne vides quanto celebretur sportula fumo?

centum convivae, sequitur sua quemque culina. 250

metretam: an earthenware jar.
The metreta was a Greek measure
of about nine gallons.

248. clavus militis: soldiers
wore the caligae militares, the soles
of which were filled with heavy

(Ann. XIII. 8) calls corpore ln-

these hobnails in a soldier's boot
Is mentioned again in 16. 2 5.

249. sportula: probably not
used here in the ordinary sense,
but rather of a banquet, perhaps
of some association, to which each
guest carried his own portion, cena
collaticia, δεῖπνον ἀπὸ σπυρίδος
(Heinrich). Duff quotes apassage
from Suet. Claud. ει, where the
word is used with this meaning.
Many understand this passage to
refer to the distribution of the
sportula in food, ln the early after·
noon‚ at the patron’s house, or to
a crowd of clients going from the
patron’s house to a cook shop to
purchase food with the money just
received from the sportula. But it
would hardly take a Corbulo to
carry home the amount of food
that a patron would give to a
client, or that could be purchased
with 100 quadrantes. —fumo :
from the culina. Eacb man is
accompanied by his slave, who
. bears a culina (portable kirchen),
in which the food is kept hot.

254-267. Here follow three pic·
tures that are to be taken together.
(1) In a crowded street through
which are passing wagons loaded
with timber and stone, a poor man,
on his way horne to the caua, is
crushed to death beneath a load
of marble which is overtumed.
(2) His slaves at home, ignorant
of his death, are busily preparing
for his return. (3) The shade of
the unfortunate victIm is sitting,
amazed and hopeless, on the bank
of the Styx.

254. sartae modo, receutly
patched. — coruscat ε the long
bearn lies upon two trucks, and
the fron't end, high over the horses
or oxen, sways to and fro as the
wagon advances. Wagons carry-
ing material for the public build-
ings were allowed to pass through
the streets at any hour.
