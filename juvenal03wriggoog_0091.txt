SATVRA IV

SATVRA lV

Ecce iterum Crispinus, et est mihi ‘saepe vocandus ’
ad partes, monstrum nulla virtute redemptum

a vitiis, aegrae solaque libidine fortes

deliciae; viduas tantum spernatur adulter.

quid refert igitur quantis iumenta fatiget 5
porticibus, quanta nemorum vectetur in umbra,

iugera quot vicina foro, quas emerit aedes?

nemo malus felix, minime corruptor et' idem

incestus, curn quo nuper vittata iacebat

IV. Tur: Councru or Donn-
111111. —The satire consists of two
parts: (1) The denunciation of
Crispinus (1-33); (2) the meeting
of the council of Domitian to de-

'-liberate on the question, what is
to be done with ahuge turbot
which has been presented to the

· emperor (37-154). The first part
has very little to do with the sec-
ond, and Ribbeck sets it aside as
spurious. Itis more likely, how-
ever, that Juvenal wrote it for 3
different purpose, and aftenvard
prefixed it here as an introduction.
[sevis suggests that it may have
been the beginning of a poem on
Crispinus which was never com-
pleted. The satire was published
after Domitian’s death (vss. 153-
154), ie. after nn. 96.

- Withthe‘ CounciloftheTurbot’
should be compared the funereal

banquet described by Dio Cassius,

i- 27, The upstart Crispinus
purchased a mullet for 6ooo ses-
1313113, and that too for his own
eating.

1. iterum. this can hardly re-
fer 1ο1.1,26-29 since Satire 113
an introduction and probably writ-

ten later than the other satires of
this book. The reference may be
to some poem not preserved.-
iterum Crispinus: cf. Plin. Ep.
V. 2ο. 1 iterum Bithyni. -voean·
dus ad partes: must be surn-
moned upon the stage to play his
part. After the introduction Cris·
pinus hasa very unimportant part
in this satire (vss.1o8-109), and
is mentioned elsewhere 117 Juvenal
only 1111 26-..9

2. nulla virtute, not a single
manly quality

4. deliciae, a voluptuary.-vi-
duas 1311111111, single women onlyr.

6. porticibus: Mart. XII. 57.
23 intra limen clusus essedo cursus.
In 7. 178-180 the lord takes a drive
in his porticus in rainy weather.
—vecteturz ie. in the lectica.

7. vicina foro: where land
would naturally bring an exorbi-
tant price.

9 cum quo: lntr.48.—vittata
sacerdos: ie. a vestal. The vitta
was 3 ribbon or fillet which bound
the infida round the forehead, its
ends hanging down at the sides
of the head. It was worn by
priests and vestals, and by 713111113,
31. Lucr. Ι. 87 sq.
