x INTRODUCTION

3. Α tablet¹ dedicated to Ceres hy some person whose
name was Juvenal was found at Aquinum. The original
· stone is now lost, and the inscription, defective in some
parts, is preserved by copies only. As the praenomen of
the person who made the dedication is wanting, it is uncer-
tain whether the tablet was put up hythe poet or by some
other member of his family. But as it was discovered at

Aquinum, which Juvenal often visited (3. 319), and was
consecrated to Ceres, whom he honored (3. 3²0) and every-
where speaks of with respect (14. 219; 15441), and that
evidently not long after the death of Vespasian3 and more
over since the tablet contains nothing that contradicts what
is known about Juvenal from other sources, it is a reasonable
inference that the Juvenal of the inscription is the poet. If
this be admitted, we learn from this source that, at the time
when the dedication was made, Juvenal had served as tribune .
of a Dalmatian cohort, had been duumvir quinquennalis at
Aquinum, and wasstomen of the deified Vespasian.

4. The references to Juvenal in the epigrams of Martial²
show that the two poets were friends, and that in or shortly

· before the years 92 and 101 Juvenal was living in Rome,

where at the latter date he was husily engaged in the weari-
some duties of a client. Martial (VII. 91. 1) calls him facun-
dus, an epithet probably given to him in recognition of his
rhetorical skill, since it is unlikely that he had become
known as a poet four years before the death of Domitian.

5. From his own writings the period to which his literary
career belongs can be approximately fixed. The sixteen
satires are divided into five books, and itis quite certain
that the books are arranged in the order of their publica-
tion. Book Ι (Satires 1—5) contains mention of the con·
questos the Orcades by Agricola in 84 (2. 161), of the death
