aut Diomedeas aut mugitum labyrinthi

et mare percussum puero fabrumque volantem,

cum leno accipiat moechi bona, si capiendi 55
ius nullum uxori, doctus spectare lacunar,

doctus et ad calicem vigilanti stertere naso?

cum fas esse putet curam sperare cohortis

qui bona donavit praesepibus et caret omni

maiorum censu, dum pervolat axe citato 60
Flaminiam puer Automedon? nam lora tenebat

ipse, lacernatae cum se iactaret amicae.

nonne libet medio ceras inplere capaces

quadrivio, cum iam sexta cervice feratur
