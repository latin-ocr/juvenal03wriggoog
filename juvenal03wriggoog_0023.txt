1¹7. The first book represents Rome as it was under
Domitian, and the illustrations ol this book, as well as
those ol the two following, are drawn mainly from that
period, and, to a less extent, irorn the reign of Nero.

· Juvenal could not openly attack prominent men of his

own day without great danger. This danger he proposed ,
to avoid (1. 170) by assailing those already in their tombs.
He introduces Crispinus Latinus, Massa, Carus, Veiento,
Paris, who had lived under Domitian, Tigellinus Lucusta,
from the timeof Ner0, and Narcissus, Posides, and Pallas,
wealthy freedmen of Claudius. But while careful to avoid,
giving offense to those who had it in their power to do him'
injury, he does not hesitate to speak freely of those still¹
living, il they are under condemnation, as Marius Priscus,
or ir they are of low rank, as Machaera, Vettius, Basilus,
and Paulus. When the same name in Martial and Juvenal
refers to one man, he is always one who was dead when
Juvenal wrote, or in a condition to do him no injury. ln
caseos men oi low rank he would have no reason ior wishing
to withhold the real name. As a rule, any personal name in
the satires everywhere represents the same type oi character.
of the literary menos his day, Juvenal mentions Statius and
υ Quintilian, but is silent about Tacitus, Pliny, and Martial;
and Pliny, who boasts of his wide acquaintance with men
interested in literature, nowhere in his letters makes any
’ reference to Juvenal.
