SATVRA VII 79

pelamydum aut veteres, Maurorum epimenia, bulbi 120
aut vinum Tiberi devectum, quinque lagonae. ’

si quater egisti, si contigit aureus unus,

inde cadunt partes ex loedere pragmaticorum.

Aemilio dabitur quantum licet, et melius nos

egimus, huius enim stat currus aeneuS, alti 125
Ι quadriiuges in vestibulis, atque ipse feroci

bellatore sedens curvatum hastile minatur

eminus et statua meditatur proelia lusca.

120. epimenia, a mantb's pra
vastam.

121. Tiberi devectum: in con-
trast with foreign and Campanian
wines, which were brought up the
Tmen—lagonae: cf. 5. 29 n.

122. quater: ic. in an excep-
tionally laborious case, bringing in
au actual lee in gold. —aureus : a
Roman gold coin. The aureus oi
Augustus contained 126 grains of
gold, and was equivalent to about
five dollars. That of Nero con·
tained only 112 grains of gold and
was worth proportionately less.

123. pragmaticorum, attar-
neys; men slrilled in law, who
gave legal advice butdid notplead.
The advocates were trained in
rhetoric but might have little legal
knowledge3 hence they often de-
pended upon the pragmatici ior
the points of law on which their
arguments were based3 ci. Quint.

1²4? Aemilio: any lawyer oi
wealth and position. Because he
iswealthyandinfluential his clients
expect to pay liberally for his ser-
vices-quantum licet, as much
as tite law allcws. By the lex
Cincia, iac. 204, a person was for·
bidden to receive money or a giit
for pleading a case. In the reign
of Claudius thelaw was so changed

that a iee not in excess ol 10‚ooo
sesterces might be taken; Tac.
Ann. XI. 5 and 7. Pliny (Ep. V.
13· 8) never received a iee or a
present for pleading a case.

12 5. huius: to be joined with
in vestibulis. — cursus: in which
some ancestor is represented as
riding in triumph, cf. 8. 3 stacam
in curribus Aemilianos. - alti
quadriiuge8‚ a staicly team csfcur.

126. ipse: Aemilius himself.— '
feroci bellatore sedens: cf.
Mart. IX. 68. 6 causidicum medic
cum faber aptat equo. The de·
scription is meant to be ludicrous.
A lawyer is represented mounted
on a spirited war horse charging
against an unseen enemy with a
crooked spear. The spear shaft

may have become bent by accident, -

or by its own weight through lapse
of time and neglect.

128. eminus: as ii aiming at an
object a spear’s throw distant.-
meditatur proelia, is practc'sing
an atiack ,· cf. 4. 112. -lusca, onc-
eyed. Mayor says ε ⁴ For certainty
of aim one eye is closed ’ς but who
would have his own statue made
in that way? Friedlander sug·
gests that the statue may have
been of bronae with colored stones
for eyeballs‚ one of which has
fallen out.
