sounding phrase, two verbs, adjectives, or substantives are
often used where one would suffice:

- (a) Verbs: 8. 37 cavebis ct metues‚· 10. 29 moverat protuleratque.
(b) Adjectives: 3. 268 alia ac diversa ‚· 8. 80 ambiguae incertaeque.
(c) Substantives: (1) appellatives: ιο. 113 reges ettyranm' ,· 4. 84 clade
et peste ; (a) proper names used to denote a class: 3. 29 Artorius ct
Catulum 10.108 Crassos, Pampa'os. Οἱ these there are sometimes
three or more: 5. 109 quae mittebantur 'a Seneca, quae Piso bonus, ’
quae Cotta solebat largiri; 7. 94-95.

VERSIFICATION AND PROSODY

vnnslrrcn'rron

80. Caesara. (a) The most frequent caesura in Juvenal’s
hexameter, as in that of every Roman poet, falls atter the
thesis ot the third ioot (penthemimeral) 3 as

3. ²3 res hodie minor est ΙΙ here quam ruit atque eadem cras.

(b) A division of the verse into three parts by caesuras
aiter the third half ioot (trithemimeral), and atter the
seventh (hephthemimeral) is common; as

3. 215 ardet adhuc ΙΙ et iam accurrit ΙΙ qui marmora donet.

(c) The hephthemimeral caesura alone is rare, as is also
the combination of the feminine caesura with the trithe-
mimeral :

14. 256 monstro voluptatem egregiam 11 cui nulla theatra.
4. 120 in laevum ss conversus ΙΙ ab illi dextra iacebat.
