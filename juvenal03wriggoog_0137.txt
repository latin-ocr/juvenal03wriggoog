VIII. ΟΝ Pruna oa Bursa.-
The purpose of the satire is to
show that high birth is honorable
only when accompanied by per-
sonal worth. If one’s life is dis·
gmeeful, noble ancestors serve
only to make his worthlessness
more conspicuous. Some oi the
lollies and vices ol the nobility are
noticed, and examples given of
patricians who have betrayed the
state or sought its overthrow, and
of plebeians and slaves who have
saved it. The satire is in the
form oi an epistle, and is addressed
to Ponticus, ol whom nothing is
known.
