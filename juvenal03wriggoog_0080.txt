32 IVVENALIS

ille metit barbam, crinem hic deponit amati;
plena domus libis venalibus; accipe et istud
fermentum tibi habe: praestare tributa clientes
cogimur et cultis augere peculia servis.

Quis timet aut timuit gelida Praeneste ruinam 190
aut positis nemorosa inter iuga Volsiniis aut

· simplicibus Gabiis aut proni Tiburis arce?
nos urbem colimus tenui tibicine fultam
magna parte sui; nam sic labentibus obstat ⁴
vilicus, et veteris rimae cum texit hiatum, 2 ⁴
securos pendente iubet dormire ruina. .

186. metit barbam: the day on
which the beard of a Roman was
shaved for the first time was cele-
brated as a festival. Here a simi-
lar honor is extended to a favorite
slave when his long locks are cut.
On such an occasion the clients
are expected to be present.

187. libis: sacrificial cakes,
which are provided ior all the
guests. To refuse one would be
discourtesy; but the slaves ex·
· pect a tip (venalibus). For the
ablative, see Intr. 35.-accipe:
sc. libum. ,

188. termentum: as leaven to
help you digest it.

189. peculia: slaves were per-
mitted to save out of their allow·
ance, and in this way often ac-
quiredpropertyenoughtopurchase
their freedom.

so insecurely that one is in con-
stant danger from their downfall.

190. Praeneste (now Pales·
trinal: about 22 miles southeast
of Rome, on a mountain slope,
noted for its refreshing atmos·
phere. Horace (C. 111.4. 22) calls
it frigidum, and Vergil (Aen. VII.
682), altum. The name is gener-

ally neuter—ruinam, tle falling
oj¹houses; cf. vs. 7 lapsus tecto· ,
rum. Thepoorer classes at Rome
lived in tenement houses called
insulae, about the construction of
which we have scanty informa—
tion. They were carried up to
a great height (vs. 269 n), were
often cheaply built, and rendered
still more insecure by the neglect
of necessary repairs. The falling
oi such buildings was a constant
source of danger.

191. Volsiniis: one of the
twelve allied cities of Etruria

192. Gabiis: the ruins of Gabii
(ιο. 1oo;Hor. Ep. I.11. 7) lie be-
tween Rome and Palestrina- Ti-
buris (now Tivoli): on the Anio,
called pronum here and supinum
in Horace (C. ΙΙΙ. 4. 23), from its
situation on the slope of the hill.

193. tibicine, prop. ’

¹94· sic: ie. tenui tibicine.—
labentibus, the falling walls.

¹95· vilicus : i.e. insularius‚ the
agent oi the landlord. He covers
the crack so that you cannot see
it, and tells you that everything is
now safe.

196. pendente ruina ι cf. 11. 13
iam perlucente ruina.
