INTRODUCTION xvii

some of the finest passages are found in these books, and
Satires 10 and 13 are generally considered worthy ol being
ranked with the best. Moreover‚ most ot the general char·
acteristics of Juvenal’s style are found as frequently in the
¹ last two books as in the first three, and the tendency to

, employ declamation‚ which hasbeen urged asa ground for

suspecting the genuineness of the later books, is by no means
absent from the earlier ones. The theory of Ribbeck, that,
’ with some exceptions, these books are not the work ol
Juvenal but of an inferior writer who tried to imitate his
style, has not been received with favor. These satires
belong to a later period of the poet's life, when his bitter
and intolerant spirit had been subdued by lapse ol time,
and when his natural powers had lost their former vigor.

14. Juvenal had one standard with which he compared
the men and morals of his own age and found them want-
ing. This standard was the austere and simple lile of the
ancient Romans. He despises foreigners both because they
are not Romans and because their influence has debased
the old national lile. This explains his disgust with the

³ Romans of his own day. They have hopelessly degenerated

from this ancient standard of simplicity and abstinence,
, and the old Roman spirit has vanished. He is filled with
³ indignation at the rich nobleman who is given over to

l gambling‚ forgery, and every vice, who drives on a public
l road and spends whole nights in dissipation, because he

has lost the honest manhood of his ancestors. When he

³⁵ condemns flattery‚ avarice, luxury, and gluttony‚ it often
’ seems to be not so much because they are wrong and mean,

l as because they are characteristic vices ol foreigners and

l ol the degenerate nobility.
