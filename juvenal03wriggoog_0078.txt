his will (cf. 1. 145 u), but the rich
do not leave their property to the
poor.

162. in consilio: ie. as assessor
or legal adviser to a magistrate
’ that had to make judicial deci·
sions‚ as the praetor and the prae·
fectus urbi. The poor man is not
called in to give advice even to a
police magistrate. There is no
other allusion to an assessor of an
aedile.

163. olim, long ago.

164. emergunt: sc. from pov-
erty. Itis not easy for the poor to
rise anywhere‚ but at Rome the
attempt is more difficult, because
there everything costs an extrava-
gant price. Though he has only a
wretched lodging the poor citizen
must keep slaves, use silver table-

· ware and appear in public in tbe

toga. Horace, a simple bachelor,
had three slaves to wait on him at
dinner3 S. l. 6. 116.

166. magno: on the anaphora,
see lntr. 26 b, and on the omission
of the verb, Intr. 54.

therefore cheap. - cucullo: the

cucullus was sometimes fastened to
the lacerna or paenula, and some·
times was worn as a separate arti·
cle of dress, being made large
enough to cover the head aud
upper part of the body; cucullo

has been thought by some inap ἱ

propriata here, since Juvenal has
just been speaking of food and
dishes, but the verse is to be con·
nected closely with the following.
11 you live among the Marsi you
may wear a coarse mantle and dis-
pense altogether with the toga. as
people generally do in the country.
There even the officials on a holi-
day wear nothing better than white
tunics.

172. nemo togam sumit: the
toga was expensive and inconve-
nient,and discarded when possible ;
cf. 11. ²04· Pliny (Ep. V. 6. 45)
mentions among the advantages
of his Tuscan villa nulla necessitas
togae. In Martial's home at Bil-
bilis ignota est toga (XII. 18. 17).
One of the conditions of a happy

κ life (Mart. X. 47. 5) is toga rara.

—nisi mortuus: the dead body

was arrayed in the toga: cf. Mart. ‚
