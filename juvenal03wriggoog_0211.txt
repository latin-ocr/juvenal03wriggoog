SATVRA XIII

iudice nemo nocens absolvitur, improba quamvis
gratia fallaci praetoris vicerit urna.

quid sentire putas omnes, Calvine, recenti

de scelere et fidei violatae crimine? sed nec

tam tenuis census tibi contigit ut mediocris
iacturae te mergat onus, nec rara videmus

quae pateris; casus multis hic cognitus ac iam
tritus et e medio fortunae ductus acerve.

ponamus nimios gemitus. flagrantior aequo

non debet dolor esse viri nec vulnere maior.

tu quamvis levium minimam exiguamque malorum
particulam vix ferre potes, spumantibus ardens
visceribus, sacrum tibi quod non reddat amicus 15
depositum? stupet haec qui iam post terga reliquit
sexaginta annos Fonteio consule natus?

4. praetoris urna: the um into
which the ballots of the iudices
were cast. Itis fallax, since it
gives an unjust verdict‚ either
because a false return oi the votes
has· been made by the praetor, or
because he has influenced the
iudices to make a wrong decision.
Each iudex was given three tab·
lets, inscribed with Α (αὐεοίνο),ο
(condemno), Ν. L. (non liquet),
respectively, one of which he cast
into the urn. -viceritr Intr. 43.

5. sentire‚seel. Juvenal makes
lour suggestions calculated to af·
iord Calvinus some comfort: (rlthe
man’s conscience condemns him;
(2) you have the sympathy of
everybody; (3) your incomeis such
that you can stand the loss; and
(4) your misfortune is one that is
common.

8. iacturae, loss ; the throwing
overboard of a part of the cargo to
save the ship; cf. vs. 177, and 3.
125 n.

10. tritus: an everyday affaire
-e medio acervo: i.e. it is only
an ordinary missortune‚ not one
selected especially for you.

11. flagrantior aequo, more in-
tense than is reasonable; cf. 11. 88.

12. viri z iae. of one worthy to be
called a man-vulnere maior:
ie. out of proportion to the loss.

14. spumantibus ardens vi-
sceribus, with vitals hot and foam-
ing,· cf. 1. 45 siccum accur ardeat
tra.

15. sacrum: because received
under oath and ln the presence of
adeity.

17. Fonteio consule: L. Fon·
telus Capito, consul in mo. 67. lt
Calvinus, now over 60, was born
in his consulship, the satire was
written not earlier than 127·(1ntr.
5). Another Fonteius Capito was
consul in mo. 59, but he is named
in the Fasti alter his colleague, and
his name alone would not therefore
be talren to designate the year.
