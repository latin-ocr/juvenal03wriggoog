188 IVVENALIS

quo loquor, egregium populus putat adquirendi 115
artificem ; quippe his crescunt patrimonia fabris,

sed crescunt quocumque modo, maioraque fiunt

. incude adsidua semperque ardente camino,

et pater ergo animi felices credit avaros;

qui miratur opes, qui nulla exempla beati

120

pauperis esse putat, iuvenes hortatur ut illa

ire via pergant et eidem incumbere sectae.

sunt quaedam vitiorum elementa: his protinus illos
inbuit et cogit minimas ediscere sordes;

mox adquirendi docet insatiabile votum. 125
servorum ventres modio castigat iniquo

ipse quoque esuriem, neque enirn omnia sustinet

umquam

mucida caerulei panis consumere frusta,

1¹5· adquirendi artificem, a
master in tite art os getting. On
spondaic verses in Juvenal, see
Intr. 83.

116. quippe, ete: to be sure
such workmen malre a fortune,
but it is done in dishonorable
ways (quocumque modo) and by
untiring industry.

118. camino, forge; 10. 61.

119. et pater ergo: and the
· money-loving father, too, thinks
the covetous are the only happy
ones and trains his sons in ava-
1Ice.-animi felices, happy at
beart ‚⁴ the only example in Juve-
nal of the rather frequent locative
onimi; cf. Verg. Aen. IV. 529 in·
felix animi.

120. beati pauperis: of a man
in moderate circumstances who is
hami„

121. iuvenes: see vs. 23 n.

122. sectae, course es lise.

¹²3· protinus: he straightway
teaches thern the first principles of

evil, and trains thern to be nig-
gardly in the smallest matters.
Verses126-133 contain examples
of such minimae sordes.

12 5. mox: when they are older.
—votum‚ desire.

126. modio iniquo: cf. Liv. V.
48. '9 pondera ab Gallis adlata
iniqua. From Seneca Ep.8o.7 it
appears that the monthly allow-
ance of grain (sar) for a slave
was five modii. The avaricious
master uses a measure that is too
small. It was one of the duties
of country magistrates to break
measures that were too small; 10.
ror—castigat, pinches.

¹27· ipse quoque: he even goes

· hungry himself ln order to save.—

neque sustinet z withan infinitive,
he cannot bear to. Poor as it is,
he is too stingy to let it all be

128. mucida frusta: cf. 5. 68;
Mart. VIII. 6. 4 mucida vina.—
caerulei: ie. from the mold.
