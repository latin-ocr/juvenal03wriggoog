. PREFACE

Tun text of this edition is substantially that oi Biicheler
(1893), but changes have been made treely in punctuation
and orthography. Deviations trom Biicheler’s text which
affect the meaning are noticed in the Critical Appendix.

In the text edition will be tound all that has come down
to us troni Juvenal, including the new verses oi Satire 6 dis·
covered in 1899 by Mr. Winstedt in the Bodleian Library. It
did not seem best to include in the annotated edition Satires
2, 6, and 9, which from the nature of their subjects are not gen-
Δ erally read with undergraduate students. Some of the read·
ings ot the Bodleian MS. are noticed in the Critical Appendix.
While this MS. corresponds in general with the o class, it not
infrequently retains the readings oi the Codex Pithoeanus, and
in a few cases may alone have preserved a correct tradition.

The commentary owes much to the editions ot Heinrich,
Mayor, Lewis‚ Friedlanden and Duff, also to Frledliinder's
Sittengcschichte‚ and his edition oi Martial. In preparing
that part ot the Introduction which treats of language and
style, important help has also been received from Kiaer,
and from the dissertations of Weise and ot Lupus.

I am under obligations to Protessor Morris ol Yale ior
many suggestions regarding syntax, to Mr. Winstedt of
Oxford tor readings oi th'e Bodleian MS„ and especially to
the Editors of the Series for their uniform patience and
tor invaluable assistance in every part oi the work.
