composed against Paris, an actor. According to the vita
oi the codex Pz'tlzoeonus these verses were not at first pub
lished, but being afterwards inserted in his writings (7. 90-
92) they were thought to be directed against an actor oi the
day whose friends were receiving promotion, and in conse·
quence Juvenal was sent at the age oi eighty, under the form
oi a military command, to the extremity oi Egypt, where he
soon died. Uponwhat foundation anypart oi this story rests,
it is impossible to say. It must have been well known in the
fifth century, since Sidonius Apollinaris, a Christian writer
of that time, thought Juvenal sufficiently described by the
expression “irati histrionis exsul.” Paris, on whom the
verses are said to have been written, was a celebrated actor
under Domitian, and died in 83. As Satire 7 was pub·
lished in Hadrian’s reign, the actor who is said to have
been offended by them at the time oi their publication
must have lived in the reign oi that emperor; and follow·

age was sent to a remote military post as prefect oi a
cohort by Hadrian. An emperor who banished ior his
sarcastic criticism and afterwards putto death the archi-
tect who had built Trajan's forum, may have banished
Juvenal for a slight offense given even in asatire which
begins with a flattering compliment to himself3 but it is
highly improbable that a man too old for service should
have been intrusted with an important military command.
Ii the banishment took this torm, it is far more likely that
it occurred under Domitian, and it has been suggested that
Juvenal's bitterness against Crispinus would be explained
it we suppose that he was the instrument of its execution.
The whole story does ‚not seem like an invention. There
is nothing in the satires to have suggested it, though the
statement that he was sent to Egypt may have been an
