73. (a) A large proportion oi the diminutive substantivas in Juvenal

have lost their diminutive signification, and hardly differ in meaning
from the primitivas from which the'y were formed; as 3. 161 sarcinulae
. (⁶ the wife’s fortune ‘l = sarcinae, which is used in the same sense in
Martial 11. 11.8 ; 10. 82 fornacula (to which the adjective magna is
j0ined) :fornax ; 1. 160 labellum = labrum ; 3. 28 bacillum = baculum.

(b) in a few cases the diminutive has come to have a special mean-
ing which the primitive does not have; as 1·95 sportula (‘ dole 'l
from sparta, ‘basket’; 8.5 auricula (the external ear) from auris,
the organ oi hearing; 10.134 buccula (cheek·piece oi a helmet) from
bucca, ‘cheeh’

(c) Many are pure diminutives, denoting that objects are small in
siae or quantity; as 11. 79 holuscula (lalus), ‘ a lew vegetables '3 3. 102

(who has so much to carry).
