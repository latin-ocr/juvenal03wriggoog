value. The Scholia Pithoeana are found in P and in a MS.
without the text in the library of St. Gall. They were once
preserved also, as far as 8. 197, in a MS. used by G. Valla in
the fifteenth century, now lost, and were by Valla ascribed
to Probus. They are based on an ancient commentary
produced in the fourth century, and sometimes contain
information not elsewhere found. They are also valuable
sources for text criticism. Sometimes the lemmata and
the notes of the scholiast come to the support of readings

- which would otherwise be uncertain, and sometimes they

preserve or suggest older readings which the MSS. have
lost.

LANGUAGE AND STYLE

24. Juvenal's style was greatly influenced by his long
practice in declamation. In several satires the subjects
are such as might have been discussed in the rhetorical
schools. He strives to add emphasis by rhetorical devices,
as by exaggerated statements, by the lavish employment of
illustrations, or the repetition of the same idea in different
forms. He freely introduces questions exclamations, com·
parisons, and is fond of strong contrasts. He frequently
turns suddenly aside from the subject under treatment to
follow' out a thought which has been suggested. Such
digressions may be contained in a few words, but more

often they extend over several verses. The satires abound ’

in rhetorical sententiae, many of which are so commonplace
that they have sometimes been rejected as interpolations.
Some characteristics of his style may be traced to the
language of everyday life, as the frequent use of diminu-
tives3 some are peculiarities of the period to which he

belonged.
