LIFE AND WRITINGS

Souncas

1. We have very little trustworthy information about
Juvenal. The only sources from which any facts ol his
lire can be derived are: (r) the ancient biographies3 (a)
a dedicatory inscription3 (3) three epigrams ol Martia13
and (4) a few passages in his own writings.

2. Numerous lives of Juvenal (υἱὶιιι)1 are preserved in

the manuscripts, at the beginning or end. These are not
independent biographies, but have all come from one origi-
nal, the best representative of which is the one found on
an added leaf at the end of the codex pithoeanus, and writ-
ten by a later hand.² These vitae generally agree that
Juvenal was born at Aquinum, that he was the son or
foster-son of a wealthy freedman‚ that he practised decla·
mation till about middle life, and that he was banished in
consequence oi offense given to an actor by some verses
now contained in Satire 7. They differ chiefly as to the
time and place of his banishment, and the circumstances·
of his death. The statements regarding his birthplace, his
rhetorical studies, and the position ol his father are not
inconsistent with anything found in the satires, and have
probably been derived irorn a reliable source.

1 Twelve are printed by J. Diirr in Das chen Juvenals, Ulm, 1888, pp. ²²·25·
25oe p. xl.
