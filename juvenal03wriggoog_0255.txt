31. apud tragicos, in tte trogic
poggsssoz. In a bloody fight‚ grow-
ing 0ut ot religious hatred between
the people of Ombi and Tentyra, a
captive was cut in pieces by his
enemies, and his flesh devoured.

33. vetus, of long standing. —
antiqua, of remote origin. Anti-

vus,· vetus means old, opposed to

recens. But the two adjectives
are often joined with the same
substantive, antiquus pointing to
the remote beginning, and vetus
indicating the long existence. This

3 ς. Ombos (now Kum Ombu),
Tentyra (now Denderahy: two
cities about 100 miles spart, the
former south and the latter north
of Coptos. Moreover, there were
several important cities lying be
tween. They were, therefore, not ,
neighboring cities, and it is not
likely that any such conflict as is
here described occurred between
them. It is possible that the peo-
ple oi Tentyra, who hated the
crocodile, had a religious quarrel
with some less important town oi
crocodile worshipers, and that ju-
venal substituted for them the
Ombites, who were well-known
worshipers ol the crocodile. Om-
bos and Tentyra are in apposition
with finitimos vs. 33.
