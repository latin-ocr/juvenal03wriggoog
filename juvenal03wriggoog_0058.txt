and other articles were carried;
cf. Sen. Ep. 20. ιο non licet divitias
in sime positos contemnere? Some,
comparing verse 150, interpret:
‘When were the sails of avarice
more widely spread?'

89. hos animos, its present
spirit; sc. habuit (Intr. 5ο).-
loculis : a case having several com·
partments for keeping money for
daily expenses, jewelry, keyS, and
other small articles of value; 10.
46; 11. 38.

90. tabulae, the gaming table.—

, arca (11. 26 serrata arca; ¹4· .

2 59 aerato orca), in contrast with
loculis, is the treasure chest‚ or
saie. Now one risks not merely
the money he carries with him, but
stakes all that he has in his strong
box at home.

91. dispensatore: a steward‚
generally a slave, who kept the
accounts and was cashier.

92· armigero: money is the
weapon with which the contest is
carried on; when that falls the
gambler is defenseless. ln 14. 5
the dice are called armo—sim-
plexne furor, is it any common
kind ο] madness? ci. 14. 284 non
unus mentes agitat furor.

93. non reddere: having lost
so much in gambling, he cannot
give to his slave the clothing which
he is under obligation to furnish.

94. quis avus: who in the time

his residence on the Palatine and
several lodges on the great roadS,
had at least eight villas. The
hlttt‘ltnttssll ”tttthl
seven that belonged ’to him and
implies that he possessed several
more. - fercula, courses. Sue-
tonius (Aug. 74) says Augustus
gave three courses, and, at his
most sumptuous dinners‚ sir.

95. sportula: Intr. 73 b. This
subject is suggested hythe pre·
ceding question. Formerly the
client was occasionally invited to
the table ol his patron and partook
with him of afrugal meal‚ now the
patron dines sumptuously and
alone, while the client has to put
nfftllb hliiilllllllllss
vestz'bulum (primo limine).

96. sedet, is placed—turbae
rapienda togatae: cf. Mart. VI.
48. 1 sophos clamat turba togato.
The clients clad in the toga are
present in great numbers at the
patron’s house and each is eager
to get his portion first.

97. ille : the patron. - tamen ι’
meagre as it is he is very careful
not to give it to one whom he

‚cannot identify.
