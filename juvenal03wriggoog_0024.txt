18. Juvenal’s literary studies included Homer, Lucilius,
Vergil, Horace, Ovid, and Seneca, oi whom the satires con·
tain frequent reminiscences. In a lew cases he has admitted
their expressions with slight change into his verses,¹ though
he is by no means to be considered an imitator oi the older
poets. But between the writings ol Juvenal and Martial
there are striking resemblances3 they treat often ol the
same subjects, many personal names are common to both,
and they employ many similar words and expressions.
They were intimate friends, but Martial was the earlier
writer. His epigrams were completed and published before
Juvenal had brought out his first book, and probably beiore
any of the satires had been written. It seems evident, then,
that Juvenal was so familiar with the writings oi Martial
that his own language and thought were not infrequently
influenced by them.² The two poets may well be read side
by side, since each furnishes the best illustrations and par-
allels to the other. ‘

19. The best manuscript ol Juvenal is one now preserved i

in the library oi the medical school in Montpellier, where it r
is No. 12 5. It was once in the possession oi Pierre Pithou, ;

whose edition oi Juvenal and Persius was published in
1585, and from him it is called pithoeanus. -This MS. con-
tains the texts oi both Persius and Juvenal, with notes on
the margin (scholia Pithocanu). The first hand (P) belongs
to the ninth century. To this have been added corrections,
variants, and glosses by four different hands from the ninth
