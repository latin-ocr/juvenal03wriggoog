like Nero, placed the life ol the

could be confiscated. Nero’s

sius Longinus, a renowned jurist,

the pretext that he had, among his
ancestral images, one oi Cassius,
the murderer of Caesar, inscribed
dux partium (Tac. Ann. XVI.
7), but his great wealth was the
real reason ior the charge against
him. Seneca, the philosopher,
