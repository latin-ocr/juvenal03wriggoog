INTRODUCTION xi ,

of Domitian in 96 (4. 153), and of the trial of Marius Priscus
in 100 (1. 49). 1t represents society as it existed under
Domitian, and many of· the illustrations are taken from
that period, but it does not follow that any of the satires
of this book were written during the lifetime of that
emperor, and the book could not have been published
before 100. It· probably was not finished till several
years after that date, as no reason is known for assuming
any considerable interval between Books Ι and ΙΙ. Book
II (Satire 6) was not published before 116. Friedldnder
has proved that the comet that forboded destruction to
the Armenian and Parthian kings (vs. 443) was one
visible at Rome in November 115¹, and the victories of
· Trajan overthe Armenians and Parthians, said to have
been portended by it, were not completed. till the spring
of 116. The earthquake which destroyed Antioch in 115⁹
is likewise referred to in vss. 445-447. Book III (Satires
7-9) appeared in the early years of the reign of Hadrian,
whose praise is celebrated in the <beginning of Satire 7,
and evidently before 121, when the emperor set out from
Rome to make ,his journey through the provinces. The
mention in 8. 120 of Marius Priscus as having lately robbed
the. province of Africa does not necessarily show that this
satire was written before the publication of Book ΙΙ, as a
man already· nearly sixty could easily use nuper of an event
that had occurred fromeighteento twenty years earlier. Two
passages in Book V (Satires 13-16) fix its· date afterthe
year 1²7· In 13. 16-17 Calvinus, now sixty years old, is
said to have been born in the consulship of Fonteius, ie. of
Fonteius Capito, consul in 67. Again, the events described
in Satire 15 are said (vs. 27) to have been enacyted lately
in the consulship of Juncus, ie. of Aemilius Juncus, consul
in 127. There is' nothing in Book IV (Satires 10-12) to
determine its date, but it was probably produced between
