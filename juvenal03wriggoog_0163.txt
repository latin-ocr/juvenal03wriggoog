SATVRA X

ne placeat, curru servus portatur eodem.

da nunc et volucrem, sceptro quae surgit eburno,

illine cornicines, hinc praecedentia longi

agminis officia et niveos ad frena Quirites,

defossa in loculos quos sportula fecit amicos

tunc quoque materiam 'risus invenit ad omnis

occursus hominum, cuius prudentia monstrat

summos posse viros et magna exempla daturos

vervecum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci. 50

ridebat curas nec non et gaudia vulgi,

interdum et lacrimas, cum Fortunae ipse minaci

mandaret laqueum mediumque ostenderet unguem.
Ergo supervacua aut quae perniciosa petuntur?

ployed in the care of the public
buildings (Tac. Hist. Ι. 43) and

ally carries the crown—sibi ne
‘ placeat, that ke be not too muclz
elated,‘ cf. Mart. IV. 59 5 ne· tibi
regali placeas, Cleopatra, sepulcro.

54. aut quae perniciosa: the
MSS. have aut pernictosa, which

a complete verse. The question,
‘What useless or injurious things
do men seek ?’ is answered in vss.
