SATVRA. VII

Vester porro labor fecundior, historiarum
scriptores? perit hic plus temporis atque olei plus.

nullo quippe modo millesima pagina surgit

too

omnibus et crescit multa damnosa papyro ;

' sic ingens rerum numerus iubet atque operum lex.

quae tamen inde seges? terrae quis fructus apertae?
quis dabit historico quantum daret acta legenti?

‘Sed genus ignavum, quod lecto gaudet et umbra.' 105
dic igitur quid causidicis civilia praestent
officia et magno comites in fasce libelli.

appreciated than the slave who
reads to you the daily paper.

more time arrd more oil are wasted,·
cf. the proverbial expression et ope·
ram et oleum perdere. Work by.
lamplight was done by the Ro-
mans generally in the morning
rather than in the evening.
Schools opened before sunrise;
cf. vss. 222-227. Pliny (Ep. 111.
5. 8 and 9) states that Vespasian
began work before daybreak, and
that his uncle, the elder Pliny,
commenced his day’s work, in
winter, never later than two in
the morning, and often earlier.
. Phrases like haec scripsi ante
lucem (Q. sr. 11. 3) are not uncom-
mon in Cicero; cf. Hor. Ep. 11. r.
112 prius orto sole calamum posco.

trates, decrees of the senate, and
reports of trials. The publication
of the acta began with Julius
Caesar in 59 ac. They were
posted in a public place, and
copies were distributed by private
enterprise. Some idea of their
contents may be obtained from a‘
parody read by the actuarius at
the supper of Trimalchio, Petr. 53.

105-149. The lawyer may hoast
of his income to keep off his credit-
ors, but he will get few clients and
beggarly sees unless he lives ina
