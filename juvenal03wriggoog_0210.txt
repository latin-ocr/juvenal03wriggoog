SATVRA XIII

Exemplo quodcumque malo committitur ipsi
displicet auctori, prima est haec ultio quod se

a basket of wickerwork so con·
structed that the fish could get in,
but could not get out again.

124. meritum mirandum: iu.
³ the vow to sacrifice his daughter,
to which the patient thinks he owes
his life.

12 5. breviter: a line would do ;
ci. 1. 68 exiguis tabulis.

127. iugulata Mycenls: the
sacrifice of his Iphigenia, as she
has already been called in vs.

119.

128. Nestora: cognate accusa-
tive; Intr. 29.

129. quantum rapuit Nero:
Tacitus states (Anu. XV. 45) that
Nero pillaged Italy and the prov·
inces, appropriating to his own use
the vast amounts oi gold that had
accumulated in the temples at
Rome, and in Greece and Asia,
taking off even the images ol the
gods. Suetonius, Ner. 32, says
his motto was hoc agamus uc quis
quidquam habeat.

ΧΙΙΙ, Consonnrrorv son Loss
or Pnovsnav vvrnouou Fnaun.

-Calvinus, to whom the satIre is
addressed, had entrusted a deposit
oi 10‚0oo sesterces (vs. 71) toa
friend, who, when called upon ior
the money, denied upon oath that
he had ever received it. To deny
a deposit was one oi the five par·
ticular sins which the Christians
bound themselves by oath not to
commit, Plin. Ep. ad Tr. 97. 7. ’
This shows that it was not un-
common.

1-22. The judge may aequit the
guilty man, but he is tortured by
his own conscience, and public
opinIon condemns him. Do not
show excessive grief over atrifling
loss. A man sixty years oi age
ought to have learned by this time
how to bear misfortunes.

1. exemplo: ablativeoi manner.
-exemplo malo: ie. so as to tur·
nish a bad precedent.

2. displicet auctori: cf. Sen.
Ep. 42. 2 nec ulla maior paena ne·
quitiae est quam quod sibi ac ruis
displicet. — ultio, punishment. -
se iudice: by the verdict oi hIs
own conscience.
