Tuis book is intended tofollow any first Latin book. Itembraces ,

in Part 1. 96 pages of easy Latin stories and fables as a preparation
for Caesar, followed in Part 11. by selectione from Caesar’s Gallic War,

equivalent in amount to the first four books. It is hoped that thus a ,

better graded and wider course, and a more interesting one as well, may
be found for young students than the unvaried reading of the first four
books of Caesar's Commentarios.

Part 11. provides a selected course of reading from Caesar rather than
the first four books Parts of these books are unusually difficult, and
parts are lacking in interest. By making selections from the seven
books, both of these obstacles to successful work have been in large
measure overcome. The selections from Caesar include the War against
the Belgian Confederacy, the Campaign against the Veneti, the two
Invasions of Britain, the two Invasions of Germany, the Siege and Sack
of Avaricum, and the Siege of Alesia

Special attention is called to the Notes. They are very copious and in
every respect adopted to the needs of second-year students of Latin.

A considerable number of oral exercises for turning English into
Latin in the form of question and answer, and some exercises for oral
and written translation, all founded on the miscellaneous matter in
Part 1., have been inserted, so that the writing and speaking of Latin

The illustrations, like those in the Allen and Greenough editions of
Caesar, Cicero, and Virgil, have been selected with care, with the idea
that they should be truly educative.

The leading colleges and universities have given assurance that the
book will be readily accepted as the full equivalent of the first four
books of Caesar’s Gallic Wor.
