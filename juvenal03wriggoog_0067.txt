' SATVRA III

in vallem Egeriae descendimus et speluncas

dissimiles veris. quanto praesentius esset

numen aquis, viridi si margine eluderet undas

herba nec ingenuum violarent marmora tofum. 20
Hic tunc Vmbricius ‘quando artibus’ inquit· ‘honestis

nullus in urbe locus, nulla emolumenta laborum,

res hodie minor est here quam luit, atque eadem cras

deteret exiguis aliquid, proponimus illuc
ire, fatigatas ubi Daedalus exuit alas, ²5

dum nova canities, dum prima et recta senectus,
dum superest Lachesi quod torqueat, et pedibus me
porto meis nullo dextram subeunte bacillo.

cedamus patria. vivant Artorius istic

phetic nymphs, ol whom Egeria
was one.

18. dissimiles veris: not like
natural caves—veris: Intr. 30.
-praesentius, more real; cf.
11. 111 templorum maiestar‘prae·
sentior. We can easily imagine
that a nymph dwells by a stream
with natural banks, but not by
one adorned with slabs oi mar·
ble.

20. violarent, desecrate; cf. 11.
116 nullo violatus Iuppiter auro.

²1-57· The discourseot Umbri·
cius, which occupies the rest of
the satire, begins with an expres·
sion of his determination to leave
Rome while he still retains his
bodily vigor, since only dishonor-
able men can succeed there.

ar. artibus honestis : tor hon-
orable occupations there is no
place. In vss. 126-13oand 160-162‘
he suggests some of the opportu-
nitieswhich he considers honorable
and would be willing to accept.

²3· eadem (sc. res) eras, etc,
and tlrz's will also wear away some-

thing tamorrow from tlte scanty
sum that now remains.

²5· Daedalus: according to ,
the tradition which Vergilfollowed,
Daedalus in his ssight from Crete
lauded at Cumae, and consecrated
his wings to Apollo ς Aen. Vl. ¹4-
l92’6inrirrivir6ccanities z he has a tew
{ffllbtnllltltssuutltl
heis becoming an old man, but
(recta) heis not yet bowed with
age and (nullo bacillo) needs no
staff. On the anaphora, see Intr.
zob.

27. quod torqueat: here the
Fates are represented as spinning
the thread of life as long as life
continues. In Hor. Epod. 13· 15
the thread of Achilles' life has
already been spun at his birth, and
his destiny fixed.

28. bacillo: Intr. 73 a.

29· Artorius, Catulus: any men
who try to gain wealth and promi·
nence by dishonorable means3
Intr. 64 a,
