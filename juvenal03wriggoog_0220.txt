et maiore domus gemitu, maiore tumultu

planguntur nummi quam funera; nemo dolorem
fingit in hoc casu, vestem diducere summam
contentus, vexare oculos umore coacto:
ploratur lacrimis amissa pecunia veris.

sed si cuncta vides simili fora plena querella,

ι35

si decies lectis diversa parte tabellis

vana supervacui dicunt chirographa ligni,
arguit ipsorum quos littera gemmaque princeps
sardonychum, loculis quae custoditur eburnis,

ten — o delicias — extra communia censes

ponendum, quia tu gallinae filius albae,
nos viles pulli nati infelicibus ovis?

1 30. tumultu, commotiore, mani-
festation of grief.

132. vestem diducere eum-
mam, to rend the top os' his gar-
ment, and not tear it from top to
bottom. At the loss oi a friend we
display the usual signs of mourn-⁸
ing, though the grief is often
feigned. Cf. Mart. 1. 33. 1-3
amissum non flet, cum sola est,
Gellia patrem ,· siquis adest, ius·
sae prosiliunt lacrimae. For the
loss of property the griefis sincere.
-diducere contentus: Intr. 39 b.

133. umore coacto: cf. Verg.
Aen. ΙΙ. 196 lacrimis coactis.

¹35· cuncta fora: besides the
Forum Romanum, because of the
growth of the city and of legal
business, Julius, Augustus, Vespa-
sian, Nerva, and Trajan had built
separate fora.

136. diversa parte, on the other
side,· cf. 7. 156.-tabellis: tablets
on which the obligation is written.

¹37· vana, sorged — superva-
cui, worthless. — chirographa,
bend, given under one's own hand.

—lignizthetabletofwoodcovered
with a thin layer oi wax. When
the defendant and his lawyers have
heard the tablet read over ten
times by the claimant's attomeys,
they finally pronounce it a forgery,
though the handwriting (littera)
and the seal (gemma), which is
treated by its owner as something
veryprecious (loculis quae custo·
ditur) show that the document
is genuine. Verse 137 is repeated
at 16. 41 with slight variation.

138. arguit, convici. — prin-
ceps sardonychum, prime os
sardonyx stones, ie. most costly
among them all, and sure there·
fore to be carefully guarded.

140. extra communia ponen-
dum: i.e. ought to be exempt
from the evils to which the rest of
mankind are subject.

141. gallinae filius albae= a
child of fortune; white was es·
teemed a lucky color; cf. the
legend of the white hen dropped

by an eagle in Livia’s lap; Plin. ¹

N. H. XV. 136; Suet. Galb. 1.
