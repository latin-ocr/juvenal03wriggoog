hinc ieiunum odium. sed iurgia prima sonare

incipiunt animis ardentibus; haec tuba rixae.

39. alterius populi: probably
the OmbiteS, since Ombi was super
moenia Copti (vs. 28), and Tentyra
was not. It appears also, from
verses 7 5-76, that the Ombites
were the people which celebrated
the festal period, and that the Ten-

Egypt with Canopus, which was a
part of Egypt. But Canopus con-
tained a larger element of for·
eigners, and, though in Egypt,
was essentially a foreign city.

and 3. 275.—toro: ie. on which
the revelers reclined at the feast.

44. horrida sane Aegyptos,

statement in the vitae that Juvenal
was sent to Egypt is perhaps based
on this expression; Intr. rr.

46. Canopo: near Alexandria,
noted for its profligacy; ι. 26 n.
It seems unnatural to contrast

fall behind notorious Canopus.

47. adde quod: cf. ¹4· ¹¹4·-
madidis: ci. 6. 297 madidum
Tarentum.

48. inde: ie. on the side of the
Ombites.

49. qualiacumque, such as they
were.

50. in fronte coronae: Intr. 3.

51. hinc ieiunum odium: tire
Tentyrites were driven on by ha·
tred and hunger. — iurgia prima :
cf. 5. 26 iurgia proludunt.

5²· haec tuba: ele. this insult-
ing language was the trumpet call
to a general combat; cf. 3. 288
