15. Naturally, then, Juvenal has respect for the old
national saith and hates all foreign religions. He treats
with derision the Greek iables that represent the gods
in human form, with human necessities and weaknesses
(13. 39—52, 833 14. 261, 2713 16. 5), and considers the Greek
stories about the underworld too absurd even for children
to believe (2. 149-152). The Jewish worship, with its sab-
baths and‘prayer to an unseen god, he regards as a narrow·
minded foreign superstition (14. 96-106). But he speaks
with respect of a common creator (15. 148) and offers sacri-

with the philosophy'of the schools (13. 120-123), but he
knew their main distinctions and his sympathies were with
the Stoics rather than the Epicureans. Like the StoicS, he*
believed in the unchangeable decrees of fate (7. 2003 12. 63)
and the providential care of the gods (10. 347), and like
them he commended the endurance oi hardship for its own
sake and a contempt oi death (10. 357-362). But, in gen-
eral, for him philosophy is simply the highest wisdom which
shows man how to live. lt irees us from our errors and
teaches us what is right ( r 3. 187-189), enables us to conquer
misiortune (13. 20), lorbids revenge (13. 184-187)‚ and is
