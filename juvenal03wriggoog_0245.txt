SATVRA XIV

et spoliare doces et circumscribere et omni

crimine divitias adquirere, quarum amor in te

quantus erat patriae Deciorum in pectore, quantum
dilexit Thebas, si Graecia vera, Menoeceus, 240
in quorum sulcis legiones dentibus anguis

cum clipeis nascuntur et horrida bella capessunt

· continuo, tamquam et tubicen surrexerit una.

ergo ignem, cuius scintillas ipse dedisti,

flagrantem late et rapientem cuncta videbis.

245

nec tibi parcetur misero, trepidumque magistrum
in c'avea magno fremitu leo tollet alumnus.

nota mathematicis genesis tua, sed grave tardas
exspectare colus; morieris stamine nondum

abrupto. iam nunc obstas et vota moraris,

²50·

iam torquet iuvenem longa et cervina senectus.

²37· circumscribere, to dc-
fraud ,· 10. 222; r 5. 136 circum-
scriptorem.

²39· Deciorum: the Decii (8.
254 n) died to save the honor of
their country ; the miser risks life
’ to save his money.

24ο. si Graecia vera: cf.10. 174
quidquid Graecia mendax audet in
histum-Menoeceus, son oi
Creon, in the war of the Seven
against Thebes, slew himself when
Tiresias had prophesied that the
Thebans would conquer if the last
ol the race of Cadmus should
suillingly suffer death to appease
Mars for the slaying oi the dragon.
Verses ²4¹·243 confirm the doubt
expressed in si Graecia vera, ia.
if we are to believe the stories of
a people who affirm as true that
which is impossible, as that legions
of armed men once sprang from
the soil.

241. quorum: the antecedent
is implied in Thebas. The story

of the Sparti, and of their combat
with one another, is found in Ov.
Met. 111.104-130.

244. ergo carries us back to
the sentence ending with omni
crimine divitias adquirere (vs
238), before the examples of the
Decii and Menoeceus were intro·
duced.

247. >leo alumnus: Intr. 56.
Your son will get rid of you as the
trained lion dispatched his keeper
in the cage; cf. Mart. Spect. ιο. 1
laeserat ingrato leo perfidus are
magistrum.

248. mathematicis, astrologers;
cf. 3. 43; ιο. 94. Your nativity
has been calculated by them, you
say, and they have foretold a long
life. He cannot wait ior the fates,
but will take you off by poison.-
grave, burdensome.

249. colus, stamine: ef. 3. 27³
10. 252³ 11. 69n; 12. 65 n.

2 50. vota, his wishes.
