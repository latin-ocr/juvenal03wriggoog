190 lVVENALIS

et melior vicina seges, mercaris et hanc et
arbusta et densa montem qui canet oliva.

quorum si pretio dominus non vincitur ullo,

145

nocte boves macri lassoque famelica collo
iumenta ad virides huius mittentur aristas,

nec prius inde domum quam tota novalia saevos
in ventres abeant, ut credas falcibus actum.

dicere vix possis quam multi talia plorent

150

et quot venales iniuria fecerit agros.

sed qui sermones, quam foedae bucina famae!

‘quid nocet haec ?’ inquit ‘tunicam mihi malo lupini
quam si me toto laudet vicinia pago

exigui ruris paucissima farra secantem.' 155
scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis,

144. arbusta, vineyards in
which the vines were trained on
trees—qui canet oliva: the
leaves ot the olive are grayish·
green on the upper side, and
hoary on the under side.

145. quorum: introducing an
adversative sentence: But if their
owner cannot be induced to sell,
you proceed to injure his property,
that it may seem to him less de·
sirable. Your cattle get into his
field at night. They are lean
(macri), hali starved (famelica),
and weary from the day’s work
(lasso), and therefore so ravenous
, (saevos) that they leave nothing.

148. novalia, the grmm'ng crop.

151. venales lecerit: i.e. has
brought into the market. It does
not follow from this that there
were not strict laws among the
Romans for the punishment of
such injuries, but the poor farmer
is at a great disadvantage if he
attempts to settle a dispute with a
rich and powerlul neighbor by

legal process, and he naturally
prefers to submit to imposition;
cf. Hor. C. 11. 18. 23-28 quidquod
usque proximos revellis agri ter-
minos et ultra limites clientium
salis avarus? pellitur paternos in
sinffr‘m dios et uxor et vir
sor ι osquenaos.

152. sed qui sermones: cl.
10. 88 li sermones lunc de Salonas
but, you say, public opinion will
condemn the rich man ior this
base treatment of a weak neigh-
bor. He replies: ‘Public opinion
cannot harm me. I do not desire
the good opinion of my neighbors
if 1 must be poor in order to gain
it.’

¹53· tunicam malo lupini
quam, I would rather have a bean
pod than, like our ‘I don’t care a
straw lor '; cf. Stat. Silv. IV. 9. 30
bulborum tunicae.

r 5 5. paucissima farra, α scanty
trop ofspell.

156. scilicet, of course, intro
ducing an ironical sentence.
