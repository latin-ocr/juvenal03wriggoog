tragedy. Agave tore in pieces her
son Pentheus, king of Thebes,
when he attempted to keep the
Theban women from celebrating
the festival of Bacchus.

88. ille: ie. Paris. There were
several actors of this name. The
one here mentioned lived under
Domitian and suffered death in 83
by order of the emperor 'on ac-
count of his intimacy with the em·
press. Martial composed his epi·

favorite with the people.

89. semestri auro: ie. the
ring gained by six months' service
as tribune. Young men of noble
families were not infrequently ap
pointed tribunes for six months
only; cf. Plin. Ep. IV. 4. 2 hunc
rogo semestri tribunatu splendide'u
rem sacius. The tribune had the

⁵ · right to wear the gold ring of the

equites, and this privilege as well
as the equestrian rank was re-
tained after the period of service
hadexplred.

90. quod non dant: ie. posi-

more influence with the emperor
than the nobles have—Cameri-

Bareae (3. 116) were noble families;

Agave, vs. 87, names of panto·

in the vitae to have been the cause
of Juvenal’s banishment; see Intr.
rand 11.

94. Proculeius: brother of Te-
rentia, the wife of Maecenas. He
was liberal in the treatment of his
own family (Hor. C. 11. 2. 5-8) and
may have been a patron of litera·
ture. See Intr. 79 c.

95. Fabius, Cotta: patrous oi
Ovid- Lentulus: there is no
other mention of any patron of
literature of this name.

96. tunc: ie. when there were
such patrons of literature. When
taient was rewarded, it was of some
advantage to po'ets to grow pale
from much study (pallere). and to
abstain from the dissipations of
the Saturnalia. This festival be·
gan December 17, and lasted five
days (Mart. IV. 88. 2 et iam
Saturni quinque suere dies), and
sometimes seven (Mart. XIV. 72
Saturni septem dies), but its spirit
affected the whole mouth.
