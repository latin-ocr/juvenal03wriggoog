76. abolla ι cf. 3. 115 n; here the

military cloak which the praefectus
urbi wore as commander of the¹
robertes urbanae.

77. Pegasus: the praefectus
urbi-vilicus: Domitian regard-
ed Rome as his estate, and the
prefect was like a slave under the
orderof a master. According to
the scholiast, Pegasus was the son
ol a captain ot a trireme, and re-
ceived his name from the figure·
head upon his father's ship.

79. interpres legum: Pegasus
was a prominent jurist.— quam-
quam temporibus: Intr. 42.

ment of offenders was mild, though
it was a time when the severest
measures were demanded.

Intr. 60. Vibius Crispus, now
eighty years of age (vs. 92), was
once the toremost pleader of his
time, and had gained such a for-
tune by his eloquence that his
wealth was proverbial (Mart. IV.
ἑέὲγ divitior Crispo). He had

n one of the amici of Vespasian

who made the well-known reply to
a person inquiring whether any-
one was with Domitian, ne musca
quidem (Suet. Deru. 3).

82. mite ingenium: in apposi-
tion with Crispi senectus, but
implying, from its position, that
his character and his eloquence
alike lacked strength and vigor;

compositus et iucundus et delecta·
tebni natus.

elade et peste: ie. Domitiam
the misfortune for the author of
it; Intr. 79 e.
