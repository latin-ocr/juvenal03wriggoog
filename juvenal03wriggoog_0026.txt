can be clearly separated from that of P. Moreover, all
the MSS. (except some that are still more incomplete)
stop abruptly in the middle ol a sentence with verse 60
of Satire 16. Therefore all existing MSS. must have come
from one imperfect original which ended with that verse.
22. There are other important sources ior portions ol
the text. The Schedae Arovienseu or Aarau FragmentS,¹ con·
sist oi five leaves which were rescued from the covers ol
manuscript rolls in the library of the town of Aarau in
Switzerland, where they are still kept. They contain about
42 5 verses from Satires 2, 3, 6, and 7. The codex from
which they were taken belonged to the same recension as
P, and closely resembled that MS. in external appearance.
So far as preserved, each page oi the Aarau Fragments .
agrees throughout with the corresponding page oi P, con·
taining precisely the same verses and the same scholia.
The Bobbio Palimpsest‚² Νο. 5750 in the Vatican
library, consists of two leaves irom a very old codex of
Juvenal and Persius. It contains fifty-two verses oi Juvenal
(14. 32 3-15. 43), with several scholia, and fifty-two verses
of Persius (1:53-104). By this fragment the reading of
P at 15. 27, Iunco, is confirmed. , ’
The Florilegium Sangallense? No. 870 in the abbey
library of St. Gall in Switzerland‚ contains 282 verses
from Juvenal. This iurnishes the new reading at 8.148‚
mulio consul, which has been accepted by Biicheler and “
Mayor.
23. There are two sets of scholia. The scholia handed
down in the inferior MSS. bear the name of Cornutus.
These are very full, but they contain little that is of much
