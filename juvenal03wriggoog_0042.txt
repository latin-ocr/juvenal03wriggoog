xxxviii INTRODUCTION

(d) The diaeresis at the end of the fourth loot, called
the bucolic caesura, is* more common in Juvenal than in
any other Latin poet} It is usually accompanied hy the
penthemimeral caesura; as '

3. 212 si magna Asturici 11 cecidit domus ΙΙ horrida mater.

81. Elision is frequent, but never occurs at the end of
the verse.

Long vowels and diphthongs are often elided. Monosyllables very
rarely suffer elision; as 3.215; 5. 593 ro.75, 217. Iu rr.r61 there
are five cases of elision, and verses with two and three elided syllables
are not infrequent.

82. Hiatus is allowed in eleverr undisputed cases, always
at the principal caesura.

The hiatus occurs once after the second thesis, seven times after
the third, and three tirnes after the fourth ; as

12. 36 testiculi ; adeo medicatum intellegit inguen.
3. 70 hic Andro, ille Samo, hic Trallibus aut Alabandis.
5. 158 quis melior plorante gula? ergo omnia fiunt.

83. Spondaic Verses. There are thirty-three spondaic lines in
Juvenal. One (5. 38) closes with three spondeos, in all the others
the fourth foot is a dactyl. One (3·²73l ends witha monosyllable

and fifteen with a trisyllable. In seventeen the fifth and sixth feet are - Ἴ

contained in a quadrisyllable.

84. Final Syllables. Final i oi milri, tibi, sibi is long only
when the ictus lalls upon it. The same is true ot final 0
‘oi verhsand adverbs, and of substantives of the third
declension.
= Ergo (3. 281) is an exception. Final ois made short in vzgr'lando

(3. 232). Final i of ubi and ibi is short in the simple words, but long in
the compounds ubique and ibidem.

85. Genitives in -iuS, The vowel i of alterius is hy
necessity short in dactylic verse. In other genitives in ius,
exceptiug illlus 6. 608, it is always long.
